Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   13
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           657 out of  17,344    3%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               715 out of  17,344    4%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            676 out of   8,672    7%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     676 out of     676 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     676   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         889 out of  17,344    5%
    Number used as logic:               715
    Number used as a route-thru:        174

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
