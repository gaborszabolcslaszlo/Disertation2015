Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network
   jtag_iface/serial_iface/dout_fifo/fifostatus_r[13] has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 48 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   jtag_iface/serial_iface/dout_fifo/fifostatus_r[12],
   jtag_iface/serial_iface/dout_fifo/fifostatus_r[11],
   jtag_iface/serial_iface/dout_fifo/fifostatus_r[10],
   jtag_iface/serial_iface/dout_fifo/fifostatus_r[9],
   jtag_iface/serial_iface/dout_fifo/fifostatus_r[8]
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:LIT:66 - BUFGMUX chain detected. Two or more BUFMGUXs are connected in
   series. Because non-standard routing resources must be used to connect the
   BUFGMUXs, this chain can result in: 1) skew between the clocks derived from
   outputs of different stages of this chain, and/or 2) skew between the
   resulting clock and clocks that use other BUFGMUX paths.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.320 Volts)
INFO:Timing:3386 - Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more
   information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line
   Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 594 block(s) removed
  64 block(s) optimized away
 576 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
