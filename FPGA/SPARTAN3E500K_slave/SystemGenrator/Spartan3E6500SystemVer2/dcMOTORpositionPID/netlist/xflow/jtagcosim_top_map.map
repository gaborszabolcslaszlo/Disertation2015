Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    7
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           650 out of   9,312    6%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               782 out of   9,312    8%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            669 out of   4,656   14%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     669 out of     669 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     669   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         936 out of   9,312   10%
    Number used as logic:               780
    Number used as a route-thru:        154
    Number used as Shift registers:       2

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    IOB Flip Flops:                       2
  Number of RAMB16s:                      2 out of      20   10%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                1 out of      20    5%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.69
