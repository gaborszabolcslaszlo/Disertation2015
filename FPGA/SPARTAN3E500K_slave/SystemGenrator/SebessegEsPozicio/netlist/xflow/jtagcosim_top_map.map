Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           692 out of   9,312    7%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               623 out of   9,312    6%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            710 out of   4,656   15%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     710 out of     710 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     710   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         805 out of   9,312    8%
    Number used as logic:               623
    Number used as a route-thru:        182

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 21 out of     158   13%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
  Number of RAMB16s:                      2 out of      20   10%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.79

Peak Memory Usage:  367 MB
